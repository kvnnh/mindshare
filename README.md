# Mindshare

Welcome to **Mindshare**, a dedicated forum-based website designed for open and supportive discussions about mental health. Inspired by the recent trend on social media where people share their mental health challenges, Mindshare aims to create a safe and credible space for these important conversations.

## Introduction

In recent years, social media has become a platform where individuals openly discuss their mental health issues. While this openness is commendable, the unfiltered and unverified nature of mainstream social media can often lead to misinformation and harmful advice. To address this, we created Mindshare, a platform where discussions are moderated by verified mental health professionals to ensure that users receive accurate and supportive feedback.

## Key Features

We distinguish between two types of users:
- **Regular Users**: Can create and participate in forum discussions.
- **Verified Users**: Individuals with verified credentials in mental health fields (e.g., psychologists) who can provide credible advice and insights.

### 3. Forum Management
Users can create, read, update, and delete forum posts. This feature allows for dynamic and engaging discussions where users can seek advice, share experiences, and support one another.

### 4. Interaction Features
- **Like and Comment**: Users can engage with posts by liking and commenting, fostering a supportive and interactive community.

### 5. Article Management
- **Regular Users**: Can read articles posted by verified users.
- **Verified Users**: Have the privilege to create, update, and delete articles. This ensures that all published content is credible and beneficial to the community.
